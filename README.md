This is a project on Equity Derivative Valuation and Interest Rate Derivative Valuation. 

The following have been implemented in Python:
1. Under Vasicek short rate process model:
   a) Calculation of analytical price of a Zero-coupon bond.
   b) Calculation of Zero-coupon bond price using Euler discretization and Monte Carlo simulation technique. 
   c) Calculation of swap rate (fixed rate leg) of an interest rate swap and the floating leg has an annual coupon payment frequency linked to LIBOR. 
   d) Calculation of price of a European Call option on a zero-coupon bond.
2. Under Black Scholes framework:
   a) Pricing of a European put option by implicit Finite Difference Scheme (FDS).
   b) Commenting on the stability of FDS scheme used and its convergence.
   b) Pricing of a down-and-out put option by implicit Finite Difference Scheme.
